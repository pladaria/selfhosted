# move2jelly

This service moves video files from a source directory to a Jellyfin media library, organizing them based on
metadata fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) and renaming them according the expected convention for
[movies](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/movies/) and
[series or TV Shows](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/shows).
